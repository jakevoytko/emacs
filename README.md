My dot emacs
------------

All of the customizations I use for Emacs. This .emacs.d configuration is usable
across Linux and OSX, and additionally across command line and windowed
environments.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

At the moment, this repo can be checked out into ~/.emacs.d, and it should work
with some minor customizations. In particular:

-   All of the packages still need to be installed
-   machine-sample.el needs to be renamed machine.el, and its contents need to
    be customized
